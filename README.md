# DSE-using-EKF

we are claiming that the results produced by the ukf and ekf algorithms are good because the z-h graph converges where z are the measured values and h are the predicted values based on the predicted values of the predicted state values. if both are converging it applies that the prediction of state ,i.e, the voltages and phase angles are correct.

also even if we provide a very wrong guess of initial states to be 5 instead of 1 the results converge very quickly.
